Andrew Hibbard is a software engineer with a decade of experience in a the visual arts. My background in art is motivated by a curiosity about how systems and ideas move through the world, and I have worked with artists internationally to deliver exhibitions, books, and projects that reflect this curiosity. My transition to engineering was motivated by a desire to implement meaningful software-driven solutions where they are best suited. An avid and eager learner, I have experience in JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.
